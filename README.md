Overview

This Python script is designed to generate a key for the login() function in a specific C program that is provided.
It uses the z3-solver library to generate a key that is different from the data value passed to the function.

To run this script, you need to have the z3-solver library installed. You can install it using pip:

    pip install z3-solver


How to use:


    Run the Python script.

    If a solution is found, the script will print a 5 digit key to the console.

    Copy the key and use it in the program to validate the user.
    
    
    
Script Details

The script begins by importing the z3-solver library:

    from z3 import *

It then defines  the digits using the BitVec class with 4 bytes:


    digitn = BitVec('digitn', 4) 
    # n is the index of the digit (digit1, digit2...)
    

These variables are represented as 4-bit bitvectors, which means that they can take on any value within the range of a 4bit integer.

The script creates a solver instance using the Solver() constructor:

    solver = Solver()

It then adds the constraints to the solver using the add() method:

    solver.add(((digitn)+(digitn+1)) %2 != 0 )
    # The sum of the digits must be odd
    # n being a generic index for the digit


    solver.add((digitn) != 1)
    solver.add((digitn) != 0)
    #the digits must be different from 1 and 0

The script checks if the solver can find a solution using the check() method:

    if solver.check() == sat:

If the solver returns a value of sat (satisfiable), it means that it has found a solution that satisfies the constraints. 
The script extracts the values of the digit variables from the solver's model using the model() method:
    
    digit_n = model[digitn].as_long()

It then prints the value of the password variable as the key:
    
    print(f"Key: {digit_1} {digit_2} {digit_3} {digit_4} {digit_5}")

If the solver returns a value of unsat (unsatisfiable), it means that it cannot find a solution that satisfies the constraints. The script prints an error message:

    else:
       print("Couldn't find a solution!.")
